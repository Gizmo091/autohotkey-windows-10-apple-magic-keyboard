# autohotkey-windows-10-apple-magic-keyboard
AutoHotKey script that allows you to use an Apple Magic Keyboard in Windows 10 with Apple familiar keyboard shortcuts.

This is a very nice tool to have if like me you use an Apple Magic Keyboard and regularly switch between Windows and Mac. Now you can use the same familiar key combinations in both operating systems.

1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)
2. Download and install the script file and open it
3. Enjoy using key combos such as Command + C to instead of Control + C to copy, and Command + Q instead of Alt + F4 to terminate the currently running app.
